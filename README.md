# 🧠 My HomeLab Journey

Welcome to my **HomeLab Journey** — a documentation of transforming an old, “ancient” PC into a fully functional home server environment.  
This repository will serve as my digital diary and project log as I explore **self-hosting, networking, Dockerization, and system administration**.

---

## 🖥️ Project Overview

The goal is to build a **complete home lab setup** from scratch, learning and experimenting with:
- Reusing old hardware for efficient server deployment.
- Setting up **Ubuntu Server** as the foundation.
- Hosting self-hosted applications like **Plex**, **Vaultwarden**, and **Tailscale VPN**.
- Adding cloud components such as **Glance** for storage experiments.
- Improving reliability through **Docker automation**, **backups**, and **network configuration**.

Every stage of the setup—from installation to service hardening—will be documented here.

## 📋 Roadmap

1. Hardware repurposing and Ubuntu Server installation  
2. Setting up local DNS and SSH access  
3. Deploying containerized apps with Docker  
4. Secure remote access through Tailscale VPN  
5. Expanding with new services (e.g., Glance, Nextcloud)  
6. Continuous monitoring and maintenance

## 🧩 Objectives

- Learn more about **Linux system administration**
- Optimize **networking and remote management**
- Explore **cloud and container architecture**
- Build a portfolio of self-hosted projects
